### Problem
Nowadays, it’s hard to find a peer to work on the projects related to your domain, the same problem I was facing when I was finding a partner to work on projects, on my campus.

### Solution
The solution to the above problem can be a platform where we can make a post about our project and make a team and start working on it.

### Goals
The aim behind developing BuildCode is to help the students to gain more practical knowledge cause a project teaches you a lot more than the normal solving coding problems, and in addition when you get a chance to connect with a person with the same mindset or more experience than yours, then you will get to learn a lot from them. We wanted to make students aware of the corporate agile environment and their work culture so that they can be able to give their best.
